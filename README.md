# -Maximizing-Leads-with-Optimized-Campaign-Budgets

B2B Financial Services Digital Marketing is a niche sector with minimal standardization of metrics.  

One key challenge in this industry is **budget allocation based on campaign performance** within a single marketing channel. To address this, I developed an optimization model using **Linear Programming (LPP)**, incorporating factors such as **Leads Generated, Leads Targeted, and Spending Patterns** to enhance budget efficiency.  

With the rise of B2B marketing services, particularly in the **Financial Sector**, digital marketing remains a specialized domain where **clear performance metrics are lacking**. A common industry challenge I identified is **allocating budgets effectively across campaigns** while ensuring alignment between **actual and target lead generation**.  

### **Key Parameters Considered in This Project:**
- **Campaign Spend Patterns**  
- **Leads Generated vs. Target Leads**  
- **Budget Constraints per Campaign**  
- **Optimization for Maximum Lead Generation**  

This model provides a **data-driven approach to budget allocation**, ensuring better campaign efficiency and ROI in the B2B Financial Services digital marketing landscape. ðŸš€
